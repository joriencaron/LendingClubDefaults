# Lending Club - Default Prediction

Mid-Bootcamp Project Ironhack - September 2021


# Problem Statement

For this Mid-Bootcamp Project I am using a dataset from the LendingClub. The LendingClub is a US Peer-to-Peer lending platform offering personal loans up to 40.000 dollars. Members can apply for loans for almost any purpose, like a wedding, holidays, creditcard payments or debt consolidation. Investors can partially invest in a loan from a 1000 dollars and up. the LendingClub creates a win-win situation where members applying for a loan can profit from intrest rates lower than banks and for investors it is a lucrative business to make money on their personal capital instead of being dependent on a stock market.

However, investing in loans at the LendingClub is not without risk. First of all the personal loans are unsecured, meaning that if a loan defaults a investors loses their personal funds. In addition, often there are multiple investors investing in one loan, which will lead to loss of personal funds for multiple investors when one loans defaults. Furthermore, members applying for a personal loan don't have to give any collatoral or pay any prepayments and in addition members pay low interest rates, leaving little room of default buffers.

As there is so much personal loss involved in defaulted loans at the LendingClub (LC), the LC is very much dependent on the trust investors have in their platform. When a lot of loan defaults and multiple investors lose their full investment, the LC will take a big hit on their reputation and investors will lose in the platform. No trust means no investors, means no loans and without that there is no platform anymore. Given these facts the LC should do everthing in its power to minimize the amount of defaults. To help the LC in minimizing this a prediction model can be created to identidy potential defaulters and eliminate them. This brings us to the research question of this project:
